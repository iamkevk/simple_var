# Simplified Market Risk Analysis Using Value at Risk for an Equities-only Portfolio of a Retail Stock Investor

## Introduction

The overview work here is a class group project for `Team 001` in the Georgia Tech MGT 6203 Data Analytics Business, an advanced core subject offered as part of the [Online Master of Science in Analytics - OMSA](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics). The MGT 6203 class, formerly taught by Prof. Frederic Bien in the Summer of 2023, covers basic methodologies, algorithms, and challenges related to analyzing business data. The class also covers applications of data analysis in:
1)	Finance & Investments
2)	Marketing & Advertising
3)	Operations & Logistics

## Project Overview

> [Value at Risk (VaR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp) is a statistical measure that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame. It's commonly used by investment and commercial banks to assess risk exposure. There are three main ways to compute VaR:

- **Historical Method**: This approach looks at past returns history and orders them from worst losses to greatest gains. It assumes that past returns experience will inform future outcomes.
- **Variance-Covariance Method (Parametric Method)**: This method assumes that gains and losses are normally distributed and frames potential losses in terms of standard deviation events from the mean.
- **Monte Carlo Method**: This method uses random simulations to model potential portfolio returns. It's more flexible but computationally intensive.[^1]
